# Blockchain Attack Simulator

This is a simulator that I wrote for ECE 8491. This simulator is used to calculate the probability that an attacker will be able to overtake the honest path of a blockchain, given that the attacker is z blocks behind the honest path, and that they own q percentage of the computing resources of the blockchain.
